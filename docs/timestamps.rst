==========
Timestamps
==========

Timestamps allows you to automatically record the time of certain events
against your entities. This can be used to provide similar behaviour to
the timestamps feature in Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

Features:

* Automatic predefined date field update on creation, update, property
  subset update, and even on record property changes.
* Specific annotations for properties, and no interface required.
* Can react to specific property or relation changes to specific value.
* Can be nested with other behaviors.
* Annotation, Yaml and Xml mapping support for extensions.

See the `official documentation <https://github.com/doctrine-extensions/DoctrineExtensions/blob/main/doc/timestampable.md>`_
for use of this behavior.

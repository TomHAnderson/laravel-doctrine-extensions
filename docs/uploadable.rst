==========
Uploadable
==========

Uploadable behavior provides the tools to manage the persistence of files
with Doctrine, including automatic handling of moving, renaming and
removal of files and other features.

* Extension moves, removes and renames files according to configuration
  automatically.
* Lots of options: Allow overwrite, append a number if file exists,
* filename generators, post-move callbacks, etc.
* It can be extended to work not only with uploaded files, but with files
* coming from any source (an URL, another file in the same server, etc).
* Validation of size and mime type.
